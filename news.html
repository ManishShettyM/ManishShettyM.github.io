        My undergrad research on an interpretation of Sepsis from an ML perspective was accepted @ <a href="https://embc.embs.org/2021/#">EMBC '21 </a>.
        Always wondered if we could map expert human knowledge (years of trial-and-error) to what models learn (training).
        Turns out interesting insight emerge from this simple experiment!
