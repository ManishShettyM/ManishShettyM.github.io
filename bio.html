    I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://ps.berkeley.edu/">Programming Systems</a> 
    group at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>.
    I'm broadly interested in designing systems, powered by predictive intelligence, to improve 
    the productivity of programmers and non-programmers interacting with data.

<p style="margin-top: 1rem; text-align: justify;">
    My research is in the intersection of <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Programming Systems (PL & SE) and Data Systems</span>.
    I'm exploring predictive tools that can simplify how we—both programmers and non-programmers—develop, interact, 
    and make decisions with data at scale using <i> program analysis, synthesis, and learning.</i>

    Towards this, my goal involves better combining <codeblock>empirical</codeblock>, <codeblock>neural</codeblock>, and <codeblock>symbolic</codeblock> methods 
    to build intelligent systems.

    developer and debugging tools for cloud reliability.
