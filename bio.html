    I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://ps.berkeley.edu/">Programming Systems</a> 
    group at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ksen">Koushik Sen</a>.
    I broadly research techniques and design systems to quickly analyze and synthesize programs.

<p style="margin-top: 1rem; text-align: justify;">
    My research is in the intersection of programming systems (PL & SE) and data systems.
    I'm specifically studying the <u>connections between programs and graphs</u> to develop efficient and intuitive approaches
    to <u>program analysis, synthesis, and optimization</u>. By leveraging the graph structure of programs and the mathematical
    properties of graphs and their algorithms, I aim to get deeper insights into the programs and their behavior.

    Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research (MSR)</a> 
    with

    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumann/">Suman Nath</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tzimmer/">Tom Zimmermann</a> on 
    developer and debugging tools for cloud reliability.
