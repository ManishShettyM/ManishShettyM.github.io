# A medley of my works and interests

Hi, this is Manish. Welcome to the mirror-land of my life and activities. Here is a little something about myself. I associate my understanding of the world to the creative, robust and innovative ideas I capture with my inbuilt wide lens camera called "The Eye". I love theorotical physics, space programs, plant and animal scientific names and the twists & turns of nature.

I am a Research Intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) and a member of the [Sankie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sankie/) team. I also hold adjuct position as Research Assistant, under Dr. Gowri Srinivasa, at [PESU-CPR](https://research.pes.edu/center-for-pattern-recognition/).

My core research interest lies in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning for variety of applications. The long term goal of my research in NLP aims at leveraging the powers of modern machine learning to better develop natural language models and also learn how the brain comprehendsthese language.

My current research efforts has forked itself in two directions as applications to ***Data Science & Machine Learning***. The branches I have been following over the past 2 years are

#### 1. AI for Software Engineering, focusing on Cloud Software Reliability and Incident Management
#### 2. AI for Bio-Technology, focusing on De-Novo drug design and Prognostic Scoring Systems for lethal diseases

I also enjoy writing, design and art. They are an integral part of my ideologies and reasoning. I sketch and also play the keyboard when I need to ideate or just keep thoughts flowing. I love basketball and can beatbox as well. Enjoy the rest of website. Cheers.
