I also hold adjuct position as Research Assistant, under Dr. Gowri Srinivasa, at [PESU-CPR](https://research.pes.edu/center-for-pattern-recognition/).

My core research interest lies in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning for variety of applications. The long term goal of my research in NLP aims at leveraging the powers of modern machine learning to better develop natural language models and also learn how the brain comprehendsthese language.

My current research efforts has forked itself in two directions but my core research area is ***Data Science & Machine Learning***. I am an ***NLP***(Natural Language Processing) enthusiast and it is also the most Data Science domain I have worked unser. The branches I have been following over the past year are

#### 1. AI for Software Engineering, focusing on Cloud Software Reliability and Incident Management
#### 2. AI for Bio-Technology, focusing on De-Novo drug design and Prognostic Scoring Systems for lethal diseases

I also enjoy writing, design and art. They are an integral part of my ideologies and reasoning. I sketch when al
