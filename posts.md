# Does creating "The Mindless AI"​ connote modern society?

A long time ago, an Italian artist - Michelangelo, painted God giving life to Adam, the first man. Ever since, the painting and the image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become iconic of humanity. Since then, dynasties rose and fell; machines started moving and calculating, and pandemics? Well, they never seem to go away. Today, we are on the verge of our very own creation (maybe not - just sounded poetic)

May 2020 saw a new age of emerging artificial intelligence when OpenAI first described GPT-3 in a research paper. The following weeks saw selected people who requested access to a private beta showing off the amazing capabilities of this model. Twitter & LinkedIn were flooded with posts describing the "mindless" nature of the language model. Every NLP enthusiast (me included) was blown away with the results and the possibilities.

GPT-3 can produce literature in the style of particular writers!! Mario Klingemann, an artist who works with machine learning, shared a short story called “The importance of being on Twitter”, written in the style of Jerome K. Jerome. Klingemann says all he gave the AI was the title, the author’s name , and the initial “It”.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another attempt at a longer piece. An imaginary Jerome K. Jerome writes about Twitter. All I seeded was the title, the author&#39;s name and the first &quot;It&quot;, the rest is done by <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gpt3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gpt3</a><br><br>Here is the full-length version as a PDF:<a href="https://t.co/d2gpmlZ1T5">https://t.co/d2gpmlZ1T5</a> <a href="https://t.co/1N0lNoC1eZ">pic.twitter.com/1N0lNoC1eZ</a></p>&mdash; Mario Klingemann (@quasimondo) <a href="https://twitter.com/quasimondo/status/1284509525500989445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There is even a reasonably informative article about GPT-3 written entirely by GPT-3. Others like Sharif Shameem showed that he could make it create web-page layouts by giving it prompts like “a button that looks like a watermelon”, by tweaking it to generate JSX code rather than natural language. Don't worry web developers; your jobs are not going anywhere.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is mind blowing.<br><br>With GPT-3, I built a layout generator where you just describe any layout you want, and it generates the JSX code for you.<br><br>W H A T <a href="https://t.co/w8JkrZO4lk">pic.twitter.com/w8JkrZO4lk</a></p>&mdash; Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

GPT-3 is the most powerful language model ever. Its predecessor, GPT-2, released last year, was already able to generate convincing streams of text when prompted with an opening sentence. But GPT-3 is a big leap forward. The model has 175 billion parameters (the values that a neural network tries to optimize during training), compared with GPT-2’s already vast 1.5 billion.

Despite its trickery and "mindless" ability, GPT-3 is still prone to spewing hateful sexist and racist language. Many have termed it as pure "Intelligence" on the AI front, but GPT-3’s human-like output and striking versatility are the results of excellent engineering, not genuine smarts. For one thing, the AI still makes ridiculous malapropisms that reveal a total lack of "humanity" - not just in itself but in the creator as well. But even its successes have a lack of depth to them, reading more like botched up articles than original generalizations.

#gpt3 is surprising and creative but it’s also unsafe due to harmful biases.
This supports the growing suspicion that GPT-3 uses a lot of its parameters to memorize bits of text from the internet that don’t generalize easily. It's language generations are like an attractive scrapbook ripped off of the internet, from millions of snippets of text that it then glues together in twisted yet wonderful ways, on-demand. This is in no way a downplay of what OpenAI has created or what modern AI is going to be. GPT-3 will be used for a wide variety of everyday applications soon. But it definitely is a reminder of what "Hype" is today. Every new AI milestone brings along and gets buried in its hype. AI is going to change the world, but GPT-3 is just a very early glimpse. We still have a lot to figure out -maybe about ourselves first.

The reason behind this lies in the fact that these models only learn from what we feed them - the millions of internet posts that they are trained on. "The Mindless" creatures are merely imitating their forefathers. And 175 billion parameters can easily comprehend the trash that we spew on the internet today. We must remember that while we might be intelligent creatures, we have a low bar when it comes to spotting intelligence. If something looks smart, it's easy for us to convince ourselves that it is. Like someone once said, "The greatest trick AI ever pulled was convincing the world it exists".

“A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human.” — Alan Turing

GPT-3 is a huge leap forward—but it is still a tool made by humans, with all the flaws and limitations that we have. #ResponsibleAI should never be forgotten while trying to conceive the future. The Turing test has always been for AI to pass, not humans to fail.
